Stanza is a new optionally-typed general purpose programming language from the University of California, Berkeley. It was designed to help programmers tackle the complexity of architecting large programs and significantly increase the productivity of application programmers across the entire software development life cycle. You can check out the website here:<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lbstanza.org<p>Here are three really cool things about Stanza:<p>1. It is <i>both<\/i> statically and dynamically typed. If you give no type annotations, Stanza behaves like a scripting language. The more type annotations you give, the more errors Stanza will catch upfront.<p>2. It has a <i>class-less<\/i> object system. We believe in both object oriented programming and functional programming, and designed Stanza&#x27;s object system to seamlessly incorporate both styles.<p>3. It has a really powerful coroutine system called targetable coroutines. It&#x27;s a <i>general<\/i> control flow construct that can be used for fine control over concurrency, and is useful for things like video games and webservers.<p>We&#x27;ve already been using Stanza internally for about two years now. Using Stanza, we&#x27;ve designed a hardware language called FIRRTL, designed a teaching language called Feeny for teaching a graduate course on virtual machines, wrote a tool for automatically generating circuit boards for robotics, and (as upstanding computer scientists) wrote the entire Stanza compiler in Stanza itself.<p>Now, Stanza is stable and mature enough for us to feel confident to share it with everyone.

After 3 years, I graduated with a decent GPA (&gt;3.6) and a couple internships at a large tech company.<p>- In college, I always felt like I had to work a harder than most of my classmates in order to get the same result. I would regularly spend 60 - 80 hours per week on schoolwork.<p>- Upon graduation, I accepted a job with the company I interned with and have worked there for ~1.3 years. However, I&#x27;ve been prepping to jump to a different role for a few months now.<p>- Recently (past 1.5 months), I&#x27;ve spent 1 - 3 hours per day on tech interview prep using CLRS, Cracking the Coding Interview, etc. My current target is a role at one of the &quot;big four&quot; tech companies or a high-quality startup doing either webdev or infrastructure engineering.<p>- So far, I have interviewed for and been rejected by no less than 10 different roles. I was also rejected by approximately 20 companies during college. I always fail during tech portions.<p>- I am REALLY bad at algorithm problems and experience serious performance anxiety. Concentrated studying and mass interviewing haven\u2019t led to positive results so far. I can solve most problems correctly given enough time (usually 2x+ longer than interviews).<p>Questions:<p>1.) Does there ever come a point where it just isn&#x27;t worth it to continue trying to be a software engineer who can get into top-tier companies &#x2F; projects?<p>2.) How can I find some positive reinforcement in interviewing &#x2F; interview prep even if I constantly get rejected? I do perform post mortems on every interview in order to find areas to improve.<p>3.) If my goal isn&#x27;t an impossibility, how can I efficiently progress towards it?
