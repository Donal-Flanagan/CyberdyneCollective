Q.1 Write a CS1 machine code programme which evaluates the function

             f(x) = 1*x^4 + 2*x^2 - 15

    for the first 100 integers, and stores the results in a block of
    memory defined by the user.
    Your programme should be clearly commented.



If you wish you may test your CS1 machine code programme using
the CS1.EXE simulator, as discussed in lectures.
