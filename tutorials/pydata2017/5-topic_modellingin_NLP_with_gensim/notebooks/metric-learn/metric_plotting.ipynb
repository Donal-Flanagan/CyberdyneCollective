    "Neighbourhood components analysis aims at \"learning\" a distance metric by finding a linear transformation of input data such that the average leave-one-out (LOO) classification performance is maximized in the transformed space. The key insight to the algorithm is that a matrix $A$ corresponding to the transformation can be found by defining a differentiable objective function for $A$, followed by use of an iterative solver such as conjugate gradient descent. One of the benefits of this algorithm is that the number of classes $k$ can be determined as a function of $A$, up to a scalar constant. This use of the algorithm therefore addresses the issue of model selection.\n",
