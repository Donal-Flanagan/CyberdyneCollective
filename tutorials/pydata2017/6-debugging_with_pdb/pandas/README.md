# pandas - a Pythonic interface

The pandas library is a key tool for data analysis in Python. It implements ideas from various other worlds (R, Excel, SQL) and bundles them in a very Pythonic interface. What does this mean? In this talk, you will see an example how pandas allows to analyze a dataset that contains a few surprises efficiently. 

The talk presents an analysis of baby names from the last 130 years, an example adopted from Wes McKinneys book **"Python for Data Analysis"**. We will discuss pros and cons of approach used for the pandas API.
