# Debugging Python Code

**Debug a series of bugs with a variety of debugging tools**

Debugging is a daily activity of any programmer. Frequently, it is assumed that programmers can debug. However, programmers often have to deal with existing code that simply does not work. This tutorial attempts to change that by introducing concepts for debugging and corresponding programming techniques.

In this tutorial, participants will learn strategies for systematically debugging Python programs. We will work through a series of examples, each with a different kind of bug and with increasing difficulty. The training will be interactive, combining one-person and group activities, to improve your debugging skills in an entertaining way.


## Course Contents

* Syntax Error against Runtime exceptions
* Get file and directory names right
* Debugging with the scientific method
* Inspection of variables with `print`
* Introspection functions
* Using an interactive debugger
* logging

## Duration

4 hours

## Prerequisites

* Basic knowledge of Python 3

## Preparations

* install IPython
* install ipdb (`pip install ipdb`)
* download data files from [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j5eir3yenke46k2/AAAkPNvTcxbAsiRG5Fh5cHjaa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/j5eir3yenke46k2/AAAkPNvTcxbAsiRG5Fh5cHjaa?dl=0)
* alternatively, download *proteomes for **human, chimp and banana** as FASTA files* from the [UniProt database](http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/)

## What is in the files?

* `buggy_code/` - the code you need to fix.
* `data/` - place to store donwloaded data.
* `output/` - place to store files generated by the program.
* `slides/` - presentation for Jupyter notebook.
* `solution/` - correct version of the program.

## Lesson Plan

If you want to deliver the tutorial yourself, consider the following agenda:

| time | activity | comment |
|------|----------|---------|
|  0'  | say hello | |
|  1'  | point to download link | participants may need time |
|  2'  | **motivate the training** | [4MAT-method](http://www.janesunley.com/The-4mat-System) |
|      | WHY: the bigger your program grows, the more important debugging becomes | |
|       | WHAT: show tutorial overview | |
|       | HOW: we will fix a program with many bugs | |
|       | WHAT ELSE: book raffle | |
|  4'   | explain problem: measure proteome diversity | |
| | | |
| 5' | **Part I: Basic Debugging Techniques** | |
| | bugfix `parse_uniprot.py` | get everyone started |
| 20' | present techniques one by one | slowly walk through bugs |
| | | |
| 40' | Part II: Interactive debugger | |
| | walk through the issue of `mean != 1.0` | see buglist |
| | | |
| 60' | Part III: Code Review | |
| | participants review `pipeline.py` together | |
| | | |
| 70' | part IV: logging | |
| | run example together | |
| | | |
| 80' | collect feedback and pick book winners | |
| 85' | buffer time | |
| | | |
| * | Code review: nuclear vault door | fallback plan |
